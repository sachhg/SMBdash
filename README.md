## üß© Architecture & Features

### Modular, Scalable Structure
- **Atomic component design:** UI primitives (Button, Card, Badge, etc.) are reusable and themeable.
- **Layout system:** Responsive sidebar, header, and main content area using composition.
- **Page-based routing:** Each major feature is a route (`/`, `/roi`, `/recommendations`, `/benchmarks`).

### Dashboard Features
- **Account Connections:** Simulated integration with Stripe, Shopify, Meta Ads, and QuickBooks.
- **Metrics Overview:** Real-time (mocked) KPIs for transactions and campaigns.
- **Spend Analytics:** Interactive charts and quick insights for financial activity.
- **ROI Analysis:** Campaign performance breakdown with ROI, spend, revenue, and optimization suggestions.
- **AI Recommendations:** Smart, actionable nudges for capital allocation and cost savings, with accept/ignore flows.
- **Industry Benchmarks:** Peer comparison, trend analytics, and visualizations for key spend categories.
- **404 Handling:** Custom not-found page for unmatched routes.

### Developer Experience
- **Type-safe throughout:** All business logic and UI components are strongly typed.
- **Path aliases:** Clean imports via `@/` alias (configured in Vite and TypeScript).
- **Mock API layer:** Easily swappable for real API integration.
- **Custom theming:** Tailwind config and CSS variables for easy brand adaptation.
- **Accessible UI:** Built on Radix primitives for keyboard and screen reader support.
